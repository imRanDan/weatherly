# Weatherly
A mobile-first responsive website that displays the weather of a city, wind-speed, and humidity. Pulls information from openweatherapi

**Link to project:** (https://imrandan.github.io/weatherly/)

## How It's Made:
I use CRA to create the application and axios to fetch and pull API info from openweatherAPI

**Tech used:** React - axios - openweatherAPI - gh-pages

## Optimizations

If I had more time I would add the option to display everything in the imperial system (for my American friends)

## Lessons Learned:

Learning more about mobile responsiveness with React and pulling information from an API with axios
